    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="farewell-2022">Farewell 2022</h2>
<p>2022 has passed. What a year!</p>
<p>Take one word to summary my 2022, I think it would be "<em>lack of
splendid</em>". Expand to some words, then I would choose
<em>deceleration</em>, <em>chaotic</em>, <em>pursuing</em>.</p>
<p>Deceleration means I feel my personal growing became slower than
before in 2022, including work, study, input and output. I spent four
months occupied in a tough project that I don't like. Only read a few
books. Barely involved in open source. Not much writing.</p>
<p>Chaotic refers to the whole world and my life. Too many events were
happened, too many disappointment, too many anger, too few hope.</p>
<p>Pursuing. In 2022 I seems lost my goal, always trying, not much gain.
I did produce some outcome, but not enough to satisfy me. What would
happened to me in the next three to five years? How to keep my
advantages? What could I be interested in?</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="fields-of-work">1. Fields of Work</h3>
<p>Last year, I spent most part of my work time to deal with the
upstream and downstream of the business logic development.</p>
<p>As one of architecture roles in an inner system developing team, I
tried to make business analysis and modeling, did some cross function
requirement design. Previously as a contributor role, I did thought less
of modeling and pre-design, but as an architect, the sights of business
problem let me treat it more seriously. In the meantime, I strongly feel
I need some methodology and systematic knowledge in design field, this
year I should take some time to read correlate books.</p>
<p>Two experienced colleagues and one consulting project, lead me to the
cloud native field. There are so many fun and challenges in such field,
last year I dipped into kubernetes, service mesh, multi-runtime, chaos
engineering, etc... At last I found that I really enjoyed the world of
cloud native: growing and very active open source community, healthy
ecology and huge investments from big company. All above have pushing
forward cloud native to move fast.</p>
<p>Taking a performance engineering project as an entry point, I start
to access to performance optimization field. That experience drive me go
back to learn the operating system knowledge from begin. And also, lead
me to transfer to another department.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-writing">2. Learning and Writing</h3>
<p>One of regrets in the last year was not read enough books.</p>
<p>Most of them were began in 2021 and I finished them in 2022, those
books include:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Done] <em>CSAPP</em> Finally read such a huge book(700+ pages),
very useful to people who "not in CS major" like me. Strongly
recommended, not just the content, but also the rigorous attitudes about
examples, exercises and even the writing.</li>
<li>[Done] <em>DDIA</em> A really good book to introduce data intensive
distributed system. Systematically summarized the design of data
intensive system.</li>
<li>[Done] <em>Linux Kernel Development</em> My first book to learn
linux kernel, the content is good, but also a bit of messy(maybe it's
the translation).</li>
<li>[WIP] <em>System Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud</em> One big
shot by Brendan Gregg, the book introduced some methodology of
performance optimization, and use manual about many detect and analysis
tools.</li>
<li>[WIP] <em>The Art of Multi-Processors Programing</em> Yes, this book
last two years to read, and still unfinished... The first six chapters
was killing me because full of formulas and theories. Hope I can finish
it in 2023.</li>
<li>[WIP] <em>Xv6 Book</em> This is the handbook (or teaching book?) of
a teaching OS, very good for OS beginners combined with 6.S081.</li>
</ul>
<p>My writings in 2022 were 11 articles in total(include translations),
that was average, not satisfied me. But some of them I do took a lot of
effort:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Design of Golang Runtime:</p>
<p>I spent quite a lot of time to read the code of golang runtime, and
try to understand it in the form of drawing. It was spilt to two parts:
computing and storing, the storing contains memory management but
currently still lack of GC part.</p>
<p>Once I finished the computing part, I've made a presentation to my
colleagues, and got very good feedbacks, that's encouraged me to
continue my attempt of explain software design by drawing.</p></li>
<li><p>How to Read Code: This article was finally published in
Thoughtworks Insights, I describe some experiences to read code, include
five steps: find a good codebase, read the manual first, read into
details, write an article about it and make a presentation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="department-transfer">3. Department Transfer</h3>
<p>Earlier in 2022, I've been thinking about make some change of
personal work, find a new job or change department.</p>
<p>The reason was quite simple, my work in current department can no
longer provide me chance and project that I enjoy. The full of
stereotyped system integration and business development work make me so
tired and lack of interested. So I decide to try some difference.</p>
<p>After six years of business-logic focused development, I want to try
some upstream or downstream work, such as architecture design, devops,
software efficiency, system development, and so on.</p>
<p>So I've transferred to another business unit at Sep. , and start to
access some solution design, cloud and performance work.</p>
<h3 id="part-time-attempt">4. Part-time Attempt</h3>
<p>In the middle of 2022, I and my wife started a part-time job with
other friends -- we sale Chinese Huangjiu.</p>
<p>It was really a coincidence to start the Huangjiu sales business.
When one of my best friends encounter an opportunity that he can buy a
very good quality Huangjiu product directly from the distillery, with
good price.</p>
<p>So we built a company to do re-packaging and marketing, then our
business started.</p>
<p>It's feel really nice when we can migrate some work experiences to
our own business. But there's also many challenges because none of us
have sale anything to anyone before. And all the staff like register
brand, design the label and box, talk to suppliers and distributors,
would done by ourselves.</p>
<p>Hope we can sale a plenty of Huangjiu in 2023!</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<h3 id="investing">Investing</h3>
<p>The investment performance in 2022 was such a disaster. The total
return were about -12.5%. Maybe it was because of a bad year, maybe it
was because of poor investment decisions. In a word, last year was the
worst year in five years.</p>
<p>My investment portfolio is combined with three parts: about 70% from
investment advisor service, about 25% mutual funds bought by my self,
about 5% low risk stocks mostly bank stocks. Comparing the performance
in 2022, the return of investment advisor service were basically as same
as self-buy mutual funds. So I have good reason to suspect the value of
advisors, but maybe the performance from advisor would become better in
good years, I still need some time to prove it.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that 2022 was a tough year, poor economy in China
mainland, high inflation in other countries like US. I Wish my
investment would got a huge rebound in 2023.</p>
<h3 id="others">Others</h3>
<p>When I typing this sentence, China have already performed relaxation
about Covid policy. And in the aspect of after-Covid time, at least I
feel my whole 2022 was full of terrifying and hopeless.</p>
<p>Almost every city had been locked down one or more times, especially
Shanghai in April. With the zero-Covid policy enhanced over and over
again, there were too many horrible things had happened. People died
because all kinds of strange reasons such as lack of ambulance lead to
go to hospital delayed, or encountered car accident in the way of
centralized isolation(27 dies), or got burned by fire because of forced
locked in home and no way out.</p>
<p>Not to mention the continuously anxiety about "get arrested" by
someone who claimed they have the rights to take people to quarantine.
There was almost no travel with my wife in the whole year, also be
afraid of be taken away.</p>
<p>However, in the end of year, due to some serious reasons(include mass
protests), the policy suddenly reversed like a joke, no one prepared for
that so many people could not buy enough medicines or get medical
services, and death continued.</p>
<p>After all that, I've lost any bit of confidence to the gov. Yes I may
still live here, work here, pay the tax. But from this time I would keep
full suspicion about any policy the gov published, and show no trust to
anyone who work in there.</p>
<h2 id="new-year-plan">New Year Plan</h2>
<h3 id="architecture-and-solution-design">Architecture and solution
design</h3>
<p>I already got involved in two or three projects that need to do
architecture design or make solutions. But obviously I did it just by
intuition rather than methodology.</p>
<p>So it's important and urgent for me to build sense about architecture
and solution design. Practice is a good way, but also I prepare to read
some books to build systematic knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="external-impact">External impact</h3>
<p>There's no doubt about the benefits from personal impact building.
Maybe in 2023 I can somehow extend my external impact.</p>
<p>At before I usually did it by write articles and published them in
company publication. It's good but not enough. In addition to that, I
may try participate industry summit to make some shares, or write useful
open source software and earn stars.</p>
<p>Maybe I can also call for help from my departments, endorsed by
company brand to join some write of industry standard or white
paper.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-knowledge">Cloud knowledge</h3>
<p>There's huge scale of knowledges in cloud field. This year I really
should put my working focus on cloud.</p>
<p>And the sub items from cloud I want to strengthen this year,
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS: architecture, design and code</li>
<li>Visualization: like OpenStack and KVM</li>
<li>Network: basic knowledge and network planning</li>
<li>Storage: distributed FS such as Ceph</li>
<li>K8s: source code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I need to continuously read classical books, I hope I can read at
least two of such books.</p>
<p>Besides, there would be good if I can read some books about
observability, performance optimization and database.</p>
<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>
<p>The gate were finally be opened after three years.</p>
<p>I wish we can travel aboard and go to some country we have never been
to. It's very interesting and relaxing in travel, especially in
somewhere have huge difference from China.</p>
