### LENSHOOD

I've been working in the IT field since 2016. During this time, I have explored many roles such as developer, architect, business analyst, trainer, and project manager. These kinds of experiences have provided me with chances to look into different aspects of the software industry. As a result, rather than identifying solely as a programmer, I prefer to refer to myself as a "software builder."

For most of my career, I worked at Thoughtworks, which has given me a lot of opportunities to collaborate with clients from various domains including ICT, fast-moving consumer goods, automotive manufacturing, and even universities. This cross-domain experience has allowed me to gain clearer insights into the commonalities and differences in software building practices.

I enjoy sharing the knowledge I have learned, that's why I created this place to share my thoughts. If you have any opinions regarding any of my articles, please feel free to leave a comment, I'm glad to exchange viewpoints with you.
