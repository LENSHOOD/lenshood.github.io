## Farewell 2021

It seems like time elapse way faster than my memory and mind. It's already 2022!

If use some phrases to summaries my 2021, I think I'll take leisure, self promotion and anxiety. 

I spend such a good leisure time almost whole year. Due to lack of project in my department, I'm stay on the beach about 8 weeks totally. Even most of my 15 days annual vacations were took in that beach time, to lower my cost. Hence, I have a plenty of spare time to do what I love to, include coding, speak sessions, learning and traveling!

It's no big deal for my "self promotion" part. The key words maybe contains read some books, dabble some techs, open source some code, write some articles, get real "promotion"(only title but maybe not pay) and try some new job contents.

I think it's quite common to say I'm anxious about my life while 2021 it's my first year over 30-year-old. The more deep dive to software development field, I can feel more regret to go into this industry in my 25 rather than 18! If I choose CS in my collage, I'm sure I can do better than today's me, I spent 7 years at my EE major, I feel good about it, but I don't love it. After graduation I meet many excellent people, they're good at coding, have passion in software technology, and love to share. But the most important thing is they're all so young and still have a lot of years to explore and improve.
