## Farewell 2020

2020 is so special to the world. The influence of COVID-19 seems far more seriously and deeply than many people‘s estimation. 

Even if the succeussful reaction by China goverment, the epidemic still casue abvious impact to every single man in this country. My salary raise freezed six months, the recruitment market seems shrink, and my company have to take many tough projects to  make more money for survive.

In my feelings, time elipse so fast at 2020, one moment I were a huge musk to buy living materials, one moment it's already summer. One moment we celebrate the new year, one moment another Christmas have passed. I continue anxious about future, and continue use coding/reading to restrain it.

At the end of this year, I may say no matter it's a good year or bad year, the earth is still spinning, people we love are still getting old, and our life is still moving forward.

If use one phrase to make a conclusion, I think it will be ”basically satisfied“.

## Improvement of Technical Ability

### 1. Architecture of Software

After about 4 years of coding practice, this year I begin to look more high view of software: from the code architecture.

I made a simple exploration of software design that why and how the code module compose like this but not like that.

Thanks to *Clean Architecture* and *Implementing domain-driven design*, I learned some basic concepts of software design from those books. Combined with daily work, the design of higher business cohesion and clearer module division can be output.

Due to supporting candidate screening, I was tried to re-doing the recruiting homework, and realized that, back to the time when I was first doing the homework, no design, only very simple module split, full of anti-SOLID. Today's me may very likely reject the old me, because good design can be simply understood and agreed but I didn't have that.

When I was reading some JDK library's implementation. I always praised such ingenious design that use as fundamental of many big system. They properly layered and carefully deliberated, reading that code make me feel so comfortable.

Therefore, from the big system architecture to some few line of code library function, no matter huge or small, maybe the beauty of software is that can make people feel harmony.
