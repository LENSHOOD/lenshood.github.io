## Farewell 2020

2020 is so special to the world. The influence of COVID-19 seems far more seriously and deeply than many people‘s estimation. 

Even if the succeussful reaction by China goverment, the epidemic still casue abvious impact to every single man in this country. My salary raise freezed six months, the recruitment market seems shrink, and my company have to take many tough projects to  make more money for survive.

In my feelings, time elipse so fast at 2020, one moment I were a huge musk to buy living materials, one moment it's already summer. One moment we celebrate the new year, one moment another Christmas have passed. I continue anxious about future, and continue use coding/reading to restrain it.

At the end of this year, I may say no matter it's a good year or bad year, the earth is still spinning, people we love are still getting old, and our life is still moving forward.

If use one phrase to make a conclusion, I think it will be ”basically satisfied“.
