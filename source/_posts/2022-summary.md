## Farewell 2022

2022 has passed. What a year!

Take one word to summary my 2022, I think it will be "*lack of splendid*". Expand to some words, then I choose *deceleration*, *chaotic*, *pursuing*.

Deceleration means I feel my personal growing became slower than before in 2022, including work, study, input and output. I spent four months occupied in a tough project that I don't like. Only read a few books. Barely involved in open source. Not much writing.

Chaotic refer to the whole world and my life. Too many events were happened, too many disappointment, too many anger, too few hope.

Pursuing. I seems lost my goal in 2022, always trying, not much gain. I did produce some outcome, but not enough to satisfy me. What would happened to me in the next three to five years? How to keep my advantages? What could I be interested in?

 

## Career

### 1. Fields of Work

Last year, I spent most part of my work time to deal with the upstream and downstream of the business logic development.

As one of architecture roles in an inner system developing team, I tried to make business analysis and modeling, did some cross function requirement design. Previously as a contributor role, I did thought less of modeling and pre-design, but as an architecture, the oversight to business problem let me take it more seriously. In the meantime, I strongly feel I need some methodology and systematic knowledge in design field, this year I should take some time to read correlate books.

Two experienced colleagues and one consulting project, lead me to the cloud native field. There are so many fun and challenges in such field, last year I dipped into kubernetes, service mesh, multi-runtime, chaos engineering, etc... At last I found that I really enjoyed the world of cloud native: growing and very active open source community, healthy ecology and huge investments from big company. All above have pushing forward cloud native to move fast.

Taking a performance engineering project as an entry point, I start to access to performance optimization filed. That experience drive me go back to learn the operating system knowledge from begin. And also, lead me to transfer to another department.

### 2. Learning and Writing

One of regrets in the last year was not read enough books.

Most of them were began in 2021 and I finished them in 2022, those books include:

- [Done] *CSAPP*  Finally read such a huge book(700+ pages), very useful to people who "not in CS major" like me. Strongly recommended, not just the content, but also the rigorous attitudes about examples, exercises and even the writing.
- [Done] *DDIA*  A really good book to introduce data intensive distributed system. Systematically summarized the design of data intensive system.
- [Done] *Linux Kernel Development*  My first book to learn linux kernel, the content is good, but also a bit of messy(maybe it's the translation).
- [WIP] *System Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud*  One big shot by Brendan Gregg, the book introduced some methodology of performance optimization, and use manual about many detect and analysis tools.
- [WIP] *The Art of Multi-Processors Programing*  Yes, this book last two years to read, and still unfinished... The first six chapters was killing me because full of formulas and theories. Hope I can finish it in 2023.
- [WIP] *Xv6 Book*  This is the handbook (or teaching book?) of a teaching OS, very good for OS beginners combined with 6.S081.

My writings in 2022 were 11 articles in total(include translations), that was average, not satisfied. But some of them I do took a lot of effort:

- The Design of Golang Runtime: 

  I spent quite a lot of time to read the code of golang runtime, and try to understand it in the form of drawing. It was spilt to two parts: computing and storing, the storing contains memory management but still lack of GC part. 

  Once I finished the computing part, I've made a presentation to my colleagues, and got very good feedbacks, that's encouraged me   to continue my attempt of explain software design by drawing.

- How to Read Code: This article was finally published in Thoughtworks Insights, I describe some experiences to read code, include five steps: find a good codebase, read the manual first, read into details, write an article about it and make a presentation.

### 3. Sector Transfer

Earlier in 2022, I've been thinking about make some change of personal work, find a new job or change sector.

The reason was quite simple, current sector can no longer provide me chance and project that I enjoy. The full of stereotyped system integration and business development work make me so tired and lack of interested. So I decide to try some difference.

After six years of business-logic focused development, I want to try some upstream or downstream work, such as architecture design, devops, software efficiency, system development, and so on.

So I've transferred to another business unit at Sep. , and start to access some solution design, cloud and performance work.
