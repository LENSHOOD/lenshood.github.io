## Farewell 2022

2022 has passed. What a year!

Take one word to summary my 2022, I think it will be "*lack of splendid*". Expand to some words, then I choose *deceleration*, *chaotic*, *pursuing*.

Deceleration means I feel my personal growing became slower than before in 2022, including work, study, input and output. I spent four months occupied in a tough project that I don't like. Only read a few books. Barely involved in open source. Not much writing.

Chaotic refer to the whole world and my life. Too many events were happened, too many disappointment, too many anger, too few hope.

Pursuing. I seems lost my goal in 2022, always trying, not much gain. I did produce some outcome, but not enough to satisfy me. What would happened to me in the next three to five years? How to keep my advantages? What could I be interested in?

 

## Career

### 1. Fields of Work

Last year, I spent most part of my work time to deal with the upstream and downstream of the business logic development.

As one of architecture roles in an inner system developing team, I tried to make business analysis and modeling, did some cross function requirement design. Previously as a contributor role, I did thought less of modeling and pre-design, but as an architecture, the oversight to business problem let me take it more seriously. In the meantime, I strongly feel I need some methodology and systematic knowledge in design field, this year I should take some time to read correlate books.

Two experienced colleagues and one consulting project, lead me to the cloud native field. There are so many fun and challenges in such field, last year I dipped into kubernetes, service mesh, multi-runtime, chaos engineering, etc... At last I found that I really enjoyed the world of cloud native: growing and very active open source community, healthy ecology and huge investments from big company. All above have pushing forward cloud native to move fast.

Taking a performance engineering project as an entry point, I start to access to performance optimization filed. That experience drive me go back to learn the operating system knowledge from begin. And also, lead me to transfer to another department.
