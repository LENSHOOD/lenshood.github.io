[Xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) is one of the best operating systems for teaching. It’s a great way to learn about how an OS works with basic functions and few line of code. 

Originally, xv6 was written in C, which is awesome for students to get hands-on experience with such a classic programming language. But now that Rust is gaining traction—especially since rust-for-linux is part of the main Linux line—wouldn’t it be fun to run xv6 using Rust? 

As a perfect way to kill the time, I have migrated most of xv6 from C to Rust. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/LENSHOOD/xv6-rust). During this migration process, I encountered many sorts of issues and tricky stuff, nothing brings me more satisfaction than successfully resolving a problem!

Therefore, I believe it would be cool for me to share my experiences through a series of articles detailing how I did this, complete with a more structured approach and clear procedures.

All right, let's get started...

## 1. Rust on risc-v



## 2. Running on virtual hardware



## 3. Debugger is our closest friend



## 4. What the xv6 is all about?
